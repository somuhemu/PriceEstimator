                It all begins with narrowing down your strategy. A thought-out strategy is the solid
                base of your digital project. It’s an important part of your digital transformation, if not,
                the most important part. When defining your strategy, we try to find an answer to
                questions such as: “who is your target audience, what is the message, which channels
                do we need, how is this going to fit the market, and at what cost?”.
